/**
 * map3/noise.ts — value noise and fBM as TSL node expressions.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS.
 *
 * The forest floor was built from products of sines — `sin(x*a) * cos(z*b)` —
 * which is the obvious thing to reach for and produces a visible CHECKERBOARD.
 * It cannot not: a product of two axis-aligned periodic functions is a grid by
 * construction, and no amount of adding more octaves of the same shape hides
 * it, because every octave is aligned to the same two axes.
 *
 * Real noise needs two properties that trick lacks:
 *
 *   1. A HASH, so neighbouring cells are uncorrelated rather than related by a
 *      smooth function. Value noise interpolates between per-lattice-point
 *      random values; the randomness is what breaks the periodicity.
 *   2. A ROTATION BETWEEN OCTAVES. Even with a good hash, stacking octaves on
 *      the same axes leaves faint axis-aligned structure. Rotating the domain
 *      by an irrational-ish angle each octave scatters that completely, and it
 *      costs two multiplies.
 *
 * Everything here is a plain JS function that RETURNS a node expression, not a
 * TSL `Fn`. The octave count is known at build time so the sum unrolls, which
 * matches the repo's production TSL and avoids needing statement scope.
 *
 * All of it is textureless by design: no lookup table, no blue-noise image, no
 * atlas. That keeps the "nothing imported" property of the whole map intact.
