/**
 * src/lab/gallery/blender-viewer.ts — loads ONE GLB into the
 * host's existing scene with generation-guarded race protection and full
 * disposal (geometry, materials, every texture slot, each exactly once).
 * GLTFLoader is the installed three 0.185.1 addon; the loader is injectable so
 * CPU tests can exercise the lifecycle without a GPU or network.
 *
 * Lifecycle contract:
 * - Every `load()` advances the generation; a load that resolves after a newer
 *   load, a public `clear()` or `dispose()` never attaches, frees its resources
 *   exactly once and resolves null.
 * - Public `clear()` both releases the active model AND invalidates any pending
 *   load. The internal `release()` only frees the active model and is what a
 *   successful load uses to replace its predecessor.
 * - `LoadedModel.dispose()` is idempotent, so a consumer disposing the model
 *   before the viewer releases it cannot double-free.
 */
