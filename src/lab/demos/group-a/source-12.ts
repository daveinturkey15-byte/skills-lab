/**
 * Source 12 — Closed-loop asset generation with browser self-verification.
 *
 * Primary source read 2026-09-12: the post, served by x.com. Author text
 * verbatim from the page's own og:description:
 *   "Wow, if you connect Fable to image-gen and image-to-3D APIs, it's *insane*
 *    for game dev. / It made an infinite explorable universe, with characters
 *    and lore. All assets and sound completely from scratch. / 3 prompts in 2
 *    hours, max effort. Workflow below."
 * The register records the named ingredients: an image-generation API (Gemini),
 * an image-to-3D API (fal.ai), and a browser self-verification loop
 * (agent-browser CLI) that let the agent VERIFY assets visually and close the
 * loop. No repository; the playable result is hosted.
 *
 * The reusable atom is the loop shape, not the vendors. fal.ai and Gemini are
 * paid external APIs and were NOT invoked. The browser leg is not run here
 * either — this lane runs no browser or GPU job.
 *
 * So the artefact is the half that can be honestly closed on a CPU: a candidate
 * acceptance harness with declared, falsifiable criteria. Candidates are
 * proposed from a seeded generator, each is measured, and the harness REJECTS
 * until one passes. The scene keeps the last rejected candidate beside the
 * accepted one, with its failing criterion marked, so the loop's decision is
 * inspectable instead of asserted.
