/**
 * Source 10 — Vibe3D asset registry, plus the 2026-09-10 editable-npm-props
 * supplement (`vibe-stack/vibe3d`, `keysforthewin/thaikit`).
 *
 * Read at pins `fb3ba78a5a21dd69db86018e74d279895501df33` (vibe3d) and
 * `92095c48ae8792132b60dfb4052c9d7b2ad795f2` (thaikit). Licence: MIT LICENSE
 * files read in both. Primary files read:
 *   vibe3d `models.json` in full — a shadcn-style config with `engine: "three"`,
 *     `paths`/`aliases` for where installed source lands, and a `registries` map
 *     naming `@scifi-kit`.
 *   thaikit `packages/props/README.md` in full — the load-bearing sentences:
 *     "Every prop is a factory that builds a `THREE.Group` in code"; each install
 *     is four files (`createObjectModel.ts`, `model.ts`, `thaikit.json`,
 *     `colliders.json`); and "`three >= 0.185.0`, as a peer dependency. The
 *     factories import bare `three`; your app supplies it, and there must be
 *     exactly one copy — a second instance means the factory's `Mesh` is not the
 *     renderer's `Mesh` and nothing draws."
 *
 * The reusable object is the INGESTION CONTRACT, not the kit. This demo installs
 * two locally authored "registry" props through that contract and shows what the
 * gate has to strip. BEFORE is the raw install: the pack's own preview light
 * comes along, the declared metres disagree with the measured bounds, and the
 * prop's collider is treated as authority. AFTER is the gated install: host
 * Three injected (never a second copy), preview lights removed, scale corrected
 * from measured bounds, collider demoted to a proposal.
