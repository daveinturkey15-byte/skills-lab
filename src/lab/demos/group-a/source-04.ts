/**
 * Source 4 — Underwater volume and waterline cutting (owner-shared video, no repo).
 *
 * Primary source actually read: the post, served by x.com, captured 2026-09-12.
 * Author text verbatim from the page's own og:description:
 *   "There's something in the water... Playing with how the underwater mesh
 *    distorts the ocean surface with domes and laminar flow around the front.
 *    Still need to get the cutting of the surface to be better, but coming along."
 *
 * That last clause is the whole reason this row is valuable: the source itself
 * has NOT solved the waterline cut. This demo therefore implements the half that
 * is solved and shows the half that is not, rather than pretending both work.
 *
 *   Implemented: a submerged body displaces the surface as a dome, with a laminar
 *   deflection ahead of its travel direction, computed per vertex from the body's
 *   position and heading.
 *   Shown as unsolved: the waterline cut. The right-hand half applies a naive
 *   depth-test cut and the artefact it produces — a stair-stepped tear at grid
 *   resolution, with no cap — is left visible and counted, not hidden.
