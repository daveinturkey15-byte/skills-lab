/**
 * Source 9 — Three.js frame-loop and visual audit (`millionco/react-doctor`).
 *
 * Read at pin `e183c3519010599d929ed14d99a18bf1f8f8a44c`, the whole of
 * `skills/improve-threejs/SKILL.md` (9,128 bytes, 103 lines). Its stated core
 * principle, verbatim (:10): "severity follows the render loop. Code inside
 * `useFrame` or a `requestAnimationFrame` callback runs 60 times per second, so
 * a minor inefficiency there outweighs a major one in a settings panel."
 * HIGH severity list at :34-39; the visual rubric table at :56-67; "Checks the
 * scanner always misses" at :93-103.
 *
 * Licence at that pin: **Modified MIT** (LICENSE read, 1,732 bytes) — the MIT
 * grant plus two carve-outs needing prior written permission from Million
 * Software, Inc.: use as training/fine-tuning/evaluation data or as input to an
 * automated ML-training pipeline, and selling it as a paid hosted product. The
 * upstream skill was NOT installed and React Doctor was NOT executed; installing
 * runs third-party code and is an owner decision.
 *
 * This is a tool technique, so the deliverable is two things, not a pretty scene:
 *   1. A real, usable artefact: `scripts/technique-lab/group-a/frame_loop_audit.mjs`,
 *      a static scanner for the HIGH-severity patterns, runnable on this repo.
 *   2. This before/after scene, which makes the same two defects observable at
 *      runtime rather than argued: the BEFORE subtree allocates a fresh Vector3
 *      and Color on every update and creates a geometry it never disposes; the
 *      AFTER subtree hoists scratch objects and registers everything for
 *      disposal. Both counters are live in metadata, and `dispose()` proves the
 *      difference: the leaky half reports resources it can no longer reach.
