 * Stable source IDs 1-17, exactly as recorded in the AKP register

 * merged and never reused; a row with no honest demo carries `adaptation:
 * 'blocked'` and omits `createDemo` rather than shipping a placeholder.

 * Alias note carried for the host: in the full 1-50 catalogue, ID 21 is an alias
 * of ID 19 and must not be counted as a distinct technique. Both live in group B
 * and neither is imported here.

 * Every import below is from this group's own folder. Nothing in this file
 * imports another group's modules, the game runtime, a renderer, or a router.
