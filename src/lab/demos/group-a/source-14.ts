 * shell. No source repository, no reusable asset licence, no technique
 * publication, and the site presents a fan-made non-commercial experience. So
 * the register's decision stands unchanged: COMPARATOR ONLY. Nothing here copies
 * code, a map, an asset or a brand, and attractive frames are not gameplay or
 * performance evidence.
 *
 * What a comparator row can honestly deliver is the rubric, implemented with our
 * own primitives so the named properties can be argued about on screen:
 *   - offscreen-connected arm and weapon silhouette (the arm must leave frame
 *     attached to a body, not float as a severed prop)
 *   - weapon-versus-arm material contrast
 *   - a local muzzle-lit read that shows the weapon's form
 *
 * BEFORE: the failure this rubric exists to catch — a floating weapon with a
 * detached hand, arm and weapon sharing one material, no local light.
 * AFTER: forearm connected back past the near plane to a shoulder anchor,
 * distinct weapon material, and one positioned muzzle light.
 *
 * This demo creates a local light. It is named in metadata.localLights and it is
 * the technique, not decoration.
