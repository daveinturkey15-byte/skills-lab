/**
 * Source 8 — Fully procedural jungle (`StarKnightt/jungle-trail`).
 *
 * Read at pin `c15640d3a2b6f08ca68e4df98fdfc953ea8a070a`: `PROMPT.md` in full
 * (lines 1-50), `src/gfx/glsl.js` and `src/render/grade.js`. Licence: MIT.
 *
 * PROMPT.md is unusually honest and is the primary source for this demo. It
 * records what the blind-critic loop actually caught (lines 37-50), and two of
 * those four defects are texture-generation bugs that any procedural vegetation
 * pass will reproduce:
 *   - "**Dark outlines on every leaf.** A premultiplied-alpha bug in the texture
 *      baker."
 *   - "**Black tree trunks.** Traced to inverted quad winding in the tube
 *      builder, compounded by a moss layer that was eating the bark."
 * It also records the honest score: vegetation was signed off at 5/10 after six
 * rounds.
 *
 * So this demo bakes a leaf-card atlas twice from the same generator. BEFORE
 * writes premultiplied colour into transparent texels, which is exactly how the
 * dark leaf outline appears once the sampler blends across the alpha edge. AFTER
 * bleeds straight-alpha colour outward past the silhouette so every texel the
 * filter can reach carries leaf colour. The bug is measurable, not just visible:
 * `darkEdgeTexels` counts texels with alpha under 255 whose RGB has been dragged
 * toward black.
