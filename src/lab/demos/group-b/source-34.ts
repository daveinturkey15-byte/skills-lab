/**
 * Source 34 - Subsystem-contract architecture (Claude-of-Duty).
 *
 * Primary source, re-read at the pinned revision on 2026-09-12 (cached outside the
 * repository, sha256 in SOURCE_RESEARCH.json):
 *   https://github.com/mshumer/Claude-of-Duty @ d9b237b75c9304ab8d9ef4cfa0c3568c7c11a853
 *   README.md (7,135 B, all 130 lines read) and src/weapons/ballistics.js (4,968 B, all 166
 *   lines read). MIT LICENSE position re-confirmed by the prior lane.
 *
 * THE METHOD, restated from the README and the ballistics source: ~55k lines of procedural
 * FPS split across 11 SINGLE-OWNER subsystem directories that never reach into each other;
 * ProjectileSim emits the typed 'bullet:tracer' event with one payload, and asks for the
 * physics subsystem lazily via ctx.peek('physics') rather than importing it (ballistics.js
 * lines 39-53, 94-107) - and (b) ARCHITECTURE.md as the written contract of subsystem
 * interfaces, directory ownership, event vocabulary and shared surface types. The README's
 * own process finding is retained: sequential single-owner passes beat parallel fan-out on
 * coupled concerns, and visual comparison against a reference was the QA loop.
 *
 * THE SCENE shows the contract's observable consequence: the same scripted shot driven over
 * a CONTRACTED bus (typed events, one producer, exactly its declared consumers - pulses
 * travel only declared edges) versus an UNCONTRACTED broadcast (every subsystem hears every
 * event - pulses fan out to all boxes). Per-subsystem delivery counters make the waste
 * measurable, and each tracer pulse shrinks by the source's quadratic damage falloff
 * 1 - (1 - dropoff) * range01^2 (ballistics.js lines 131-132) so the borrowed vocabulary is
 * visible, not decorated.
 *
 * This is a scale model of an architecture, not the game: stated plainly in the limitation.
