 * LICENCE POSITION: the site's licence page reserves the design of the page, its key visuals,
 * the gamepad model and its audio. NOTHING of its markup, CSS, art, audio or code may be
 * taken. What is reproduced below is BEHAVIOUR described in our own words and implemented in
 * our own code - the route the carrier skill `game-hud-menu-overhaul` (v1.1.0, lines 30-77)
 * already records for this row.
 *
 * The two pieces of arithmetic were confirmed against the source module rather than trusted
 * from the register summary: `const TAU = Math.PI * 2` (main.js line 11), and the ring
 * geometry `const R = (N * (W + GAP)) / TAU; const STEP = TAU / N;` (main.js lines 101-102).
 * Deriving the radius from item count is what keeps card spacing constant as a roster grows,
 * and it is the reason one card-width of pointer travel can equal exactly one step.
 *
 * Demonstrated here: ring geometry from item count, short-way rotation modulo N, two-stage
 * commit (activating a side card only brings it to the front; only the front card launches),
 * and the content-derived accent colour WITH the saturation/lightness clamp that guarantees
 * contrast instead of hoping for it. The clamp is shown as an explicit before/after pair of
 * swatches, because the clamp is the part that is easy to drop and expensive to lose.
