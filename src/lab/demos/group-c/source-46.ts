/**
 * Source 46 — Three.js Water Pro: Beer-Lambert absorption, broadband bubble
 * backscatter injected UPSTREAM of the absorption integral, and the breaking
 * estimator that is supposed to drive both.
 *
 * Licence position, and why this is the cleanest row in the group: the shipped
 * library is a paid Commercial Software License Agreement v2.2 (DRG Software
 * Solutions LLC, all rights reserved) — read as terms at
 * docs.threejswaterpro.com/license.html. Nothing was purchased, downloaded,
 * unpacked or deobfuscated, and the product repository `dgreenheck/webgpu-water`
 * is 404 (re-verified by this lane). The physics below is published graphics and
 * oceanography, not his expression: Beer-Lambert attenuation, the fact that
 * entrained bubble clouds scatter close to spectrally flat, and the Jacobian
 * fold test that has been the standard breaking criterion for displaced wave
 * surfaces since Tessendorf.
 *
 * THE METHOD — three claims, each now implemented rather than described:
 *
 *   1. WHERE the flat bubble source is injected decides the hue:
 *
 *        CORRECT (after panel)  L = bg·e^(-a·d) + ∫₀^d S·e^(-a·s) ds
 *                                 = bg·e^(-a·d) + (S/a)·(1 - e^(-a·d))
 *              The flat source is filtered BY the absorption on its way out, so
 *              the 1/a factor makes it emerge brighter AND green-shifted,
 *              because a is smallest in the green.
 *
 *        WRONG (before panel)   L = bg·e^(-a·d) + S·d
 *              The SAME source over the SAME path — equal scattered energy —
 *              added as a white tint after the integral instead of inside it.
 *              Flat in, flat out: the water goes pale and grey however much of
 *              it you add. Reproduced on purpose, so the mistake the source
 *              post exists to warn about stays inspectable beside the fix.
 *
 *   2. WHAT drives the source is not a slope proxy. The register (item 7) and
 *      the carrier skill both name the estimator: the determinant of the
 *      HORIZONTAL-DISPLACEMENT JACOBIAN. Where neighbouring surface points are
 *      pushed onto each other the map stops being injective; J falls below 1
 *      under compression and through 0 where the surface folds over itself,
 *      and that fold is where air is entrained. `gerstnerChop` returns the
 *      analytic J of exactly the displacement it applies, so the vertex
 *      crowding you can see IS the number the foam is computed from.
 *
 *   3. HOW LONG it lasts is state, not a threshold. Foam energy accumulates
 *      into a field held per surface point and decays exponentially, so it
 *      rolls off the back of a breaker instead of blinking with the crest. The
 *      bubble source for (1) is the SAME state on the SAME time constant —
 *      "foam is the bubbles that reached the surface, backscatter is the ones
 *      that did not". Surface foam is composited AFTER absorption because it
 *      floats on top of the water; the bubbles go inside the integral because
 *      they are under it. Two consumers, one estimator, one decay.
 *
 * FORGE REUSE, concretely: the spectrum is NOT reimplemented. Directions,
 * wavelengths, dispersion, relative weights and phases all come from
 * `OCEAN_BANDS` in `src/water/ocean-spectrum.ts`, the repository's sole CPU
 * ocean authority, and `sampleOcean` still supplies the vertical field. Two
 * knobs the exhibit declares openly are moved: global amplitude and the Gerstner
 * choppiness Q. See EXHIBIT_* below — and see `shippingJacobianMinimum` in the
 * counters, which is the measured statement that our shipped sea cannot break.
